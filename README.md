## 🔧 Installation  

### Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamEquinox-05/HackIndia-Spark-3-2025-Equinox.git
```

**Set Up Fake News & Post Detection**
1. **Upload `TruthShield.ipynb` to Google Colab** and follow the instructions.  
2. **Obtain an Ngrok URL** after running the API server in Colab.  
3. **Update `content.js`**:  
   - Replace `FLASK_SERVER_API` in the extension script with your **Ngrok API URL**.  
4. **Load the Extension in Chrome:**  
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`  
   - Enable **Developer Mode**  
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder (`fake-news-extension`).  
5. **Test the Extension:**  
   - Open `test.html` to verify functionality.  
   - Works on **X (Twitter) posts** and general **website content detection**.  

   ## 📌 How It Works  
   - The extension **injects a script** into web pages to analyze content.  
   - It sends the extracted text to the Flask server for **AI-based analysis**.  
   - The API returns:  
     - **Label** (`Fake`, `Real`, `AI-Generated`, etc.)  
     - **Confidence Score** (`0-100%`)  
   - Results appear as an **overlay** on the webpage.  

   ## Example Usage  
   
   ### 🔍 Fake News Detection on X (Twitter)  
   - Scans tweets and labels them as **Fake** or **Real**.  
   - Displays an **overlay with a confidence score**.
